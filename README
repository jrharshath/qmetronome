Installing qmetronome:

--------------------------
1. Compilation
--------------------------
To compile, you need to have qt development tools installed. 
Compile command:

    qmake && make

---------------------------
2. Running the app
---------------------------
To run the app, it must be able to find its configuration.
By default, the app looks for its configuration in two places:

  1. in ./conf
  2. in ~/.qmetronome

there is a configuration in ~/conf by default, so installation is requisite, per se.
however, you might want to do this:

    cp ./conf ~/.qmetronome -r

to create a copy of the configurate in your home.

No you can run the application from anywhere in your system.

--------------------------
 CREDITS
--------------------------
I would credit all the unsatisfactory metronomes I've tried using on ubuntu ;)
Without them, I would never have made this effort.


--------------------------
 Free Code
--------------------------
This code is free as a bird. If you try to cage it, your underpants will catch fire.
